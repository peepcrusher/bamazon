# Bamazon

## Purpose

This is a  command line application that simulates a store. With Bamazon you can view items for sale, buy items, and if you know the super secret password, which is definitely not the name of my instructors cat, you can get into the manager options and add, restock, and view low stock items. Bamazon will not allow you to buy more of an item that is in stock, or buy negative items. Similarly, you cannot restock negative items.
